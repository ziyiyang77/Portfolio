            <h3 class="name-title">Ziyi Yang</h3>
            <p class="biography">Hello there! I'm a budding game developer and student at the University of Southern
                California. I'm currently studying Computer Science Games and look forward to graduating in 2026.</p>

            <p class="biography"> My passion for gaming has been a constant companion for 14 years, evolving from simple
                web games to the immersive realms of mobile, PC, and VR gaming. Five years ago, I transitioned from a
                player to a creator, embarking on the thrilling path of game development.</p>

            <p class="biography">While my primary focus lies in programming—bringing mechanics and virtual worlds to
                life—I also indulge in the art of drawing. My sketches are often inspired by the vibrant storytelling of
                Japanese anime, which I deeply love and celebrate through fan art. </p>

            <h3 class="skills-title"><strong>Skills</strong></h3>

            <ul class="skills-list">
                <li>C++ and C# Programming</li>
                <li>Unity and Unreal Engine</li>
                <li>Game Design Fundamentals</li>
                <li>2D Art Design</li>
                <li>Sound Design</li>
                <li>Narrative Development</li>
                <li>Animation</li>
                <li>HTML Programming</li>
            </ul>


            <h3 class="gaming-experience-title"><strong>Gaming Experience</strong></h3>

            <p class="gaming-experience-description">Except for the digital games in the Profolio Section, I've crafted
                five board games that span from mystery puzzles to lively party challenges, engaging players in both
                cooperative and competitive gameplay.</p>

            <p class="gaming-experience-description">I've got mobile game prototypes draw inspiration from classics like
                "Candy Crush" and "Flappy Bird," and I've also developed small PC games reminiscent of "Mario" and
                "Portal."</p>

            <p class="gaming-experience-description">In all these endeavors, my primary role revolves around programming
                and game design, but my dedication to art shines through in the board games, where I bring themes and
                characters to life with vivid illustrations.</p>
